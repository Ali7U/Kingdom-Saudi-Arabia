        <h5 class="card-title">Saudi Arabia</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          Saudi Arabia, arid, sparsely populated kingdom of the Middle East.
          Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia Extending across most of the northern and
          central Arabian Peninsula, Saudi Arabia is a young country that is
          heir to a rich history. In its western highlands, along the Red Sea,
          lies the Hejaz, which is the cradle of Islam and the site of that
          religion’s holiest cities, Mecca and Medina. In the country’s
          geographic heartland is a region known as Najd (“Highland”), a vast
          arid zone that until recent times was populated by nomadic tribes. To
          the east, along the Persian Gulf, are the country’s abundant oil
          fields that, since the 1960s, have made Saudi Arabia synonymous with
          petroleum wealth. Those three elements—religion, tribalism, and untold
          wealth—have fueled the country’s subsequent history. Mecca, Saudi
          Arabia Mecca, Saudi Arabia It was only with the rise of the Saud
          family (Āl Saʿūd)—a Najdi group for which the country is named—and its
          eventual consolidation of power in the early 20th century that Saudi
          Arabia began to take on the characteristics of a modern country. The
          success of the Saud family was in no small part due to the motivating
          ideology of Wahhābism, an austere form of Islam that was embraced by
          early family leaders and that became the state creed. This deep
          religious conservatism has been accompanied by a ubiquitous
          tribalism—in which competing family groups vie for resources and
          status—that often has made Saudi society difficult for outsiders to
          comprehend. Enormous oil wealth has fueled huge and rapid investment
          in Saudi Arabia’s infrastructure. Many citizens have benefited from
          this growth, but it also has supported lavish lifestyles for the
          scions of the ruling family, and religious conservatives and liberal
          democrats alike have accused the family of squandering and mishandling
          the country’s wealth. In addition, civil discontent increased after
          the Persian Gulf War (1990–91) over the country’s close ties to the
          West, symbolized notably by the U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia
          until 2005. Mecca, Saudi Arabia Mecca, Saudi Arabia In the mid-20th
          century, most of Saudi Arabia still embraced a traditional lifestyle
          that had changed little over thousands of years. Since then the pace
          of life in Saudi Arabia accelerated rapidly. The constant flow of
          pilgrims to Mecca and Medina (vast throngs arrive for the annual hajj,
          and more pilgrims visit throughout the year for the lesser pilgrimage,
          the ʿumrah) had always provided the country with outside contacts, but
          interaction with the outside world expanded with innovations in
          transportation, technology, and organization. Saudi Arabia’s growing
          petroleum wealth also wrought irreversible domestic
          changes—educational and social as well as economic. Modern methods of
          production have been superimposed on a traditional society by the
          introduction of millions of foreign workers and by the employment of
          hundreds of thousands of Saudis in nontraditional jobs. In addition,
          tens of thousands of Saudi students have studied abroad, most in the
          United States. Television, radio, and the Internet have become common
          media of communication and education, and highways and airways have
          replaced traditional means of transportation.
