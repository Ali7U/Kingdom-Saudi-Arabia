                second-holiest city, is 360 kilometers (220 mi) to the north.
                Economically, Jeddah is focusing on further developing capital
                investment in scientific and engineering leadership within Saudi
                Arabia, and the Middle East.[7] Jeddah was ranked fourth in the
                Africa, Middle East, and 'stan countries region in the
                Innovation Cities Index in 2009.

                The city of Makkah itself is only accessible to Muslims. Each
                year, it bears witness to the Hajj pilgrimage, a religious duty
                that must be performed by every able Muslim at least once in
                their lifetime, and which draws millions each year. Holy sites
                in the city include the sacred Ka’aba, located in the heart of
                the Masjid al-Haram, or Grand Mosque, while the circling
                mountains house the historic Cave of Thawr, where the Prophet
                sought refuge from the Quraysh tribe, and the revered Jabal
                Rahmah, where he delivered his last sermon.

                  The scenic capital of the Asir province, Abha offers some
                  amazing natural wonders that are meant to be experienced
                  first-hand. Add in the great climate of the city and you are
                  in for a delightful experience. Abha is located at a height of
                  around 2,200 meters above sea level and is home to some of the
                  tallest peaks in Saudi Arabia. Due to its milder climate, it
                  is an increasingly popular destination both for locals and
                  international tourists. The city is connected to Jeddah by a
                  coastal highway and SAPTCO buses can be used to travel to and
                  from other cities in the country. The Abha International
                  Airport serves as the main airport of the city.

                <p class="card-text">
                  One of the kingdom’s 13 provinces, the Qassim region is known
                  for its wheat, which it exports heavily, and its dates, which
                  are popular throughout the country. Perhaps this is why Qassim
                  is also called the “food basket” of the country. The area is
                  actually relatively rich in water and has soil and a climate
                  that is suitable for growing most crops, including grapes,
                  oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarin oranges, pomegranates
                  and many vegetables. The main market in Buraydah, the
                  province’s capital city (which is inhabited by approximately
                  60 percent of the region’s total population), offers a variety
                  of dates year-round. If you’re visiting at the end of the
                  summer, you might catch the annual Buraydah Date Festival, a
                  35-day event, which draws farmers and tourists from
                  neighboring regions and countries every year to sell dates and
                  date by-products, like date syrup. Qassim has a desert
                  climate, with long, hot summers and short, mild winters, and
                  there’s little precipitation, so it’s a great place to get out
                  and explore.
